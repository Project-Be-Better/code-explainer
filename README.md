# 🧠 Code Explainer

This repository contains my **structured, Zettelkasten-style notes** from reading and understanding real-world C++ code during my [100 Days of C++](https://github.com/Project-Be-Better/learning-cpp) challenge and ongoing systems-level work.

Every file here is a **deep dive into one or more C++ source files** — covering:
- What the file/module does
- How it's structured
- Key APIs and design patterns used
- Code snippets and UMLs
- My learning takeaways
- Questions for further exploration
