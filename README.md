# 🧠 Code Explainer


This repository contains my **structured, Zettelkasten-style notes** from reading and understanding real-world C++ code during my [100 Days of C++](https://github.com/Project-Be-Better/learning-cpp) challenge and ongoing systems-level work.
Every file here is a **deep dive into one or more C++ source files** — covering:
- What the file/module does
- How it's structured
- Key APIs and design patterns used
- Code snippets and UMLs
- My learning takeaways
- Questions for further exploration


## 🗂️ Organization

Each folder maps to a project or domain, and each note follows a consistent template:

```
code_explainer/
├── teletrack_sim/
│   ├── mqtt_publisher/
│   │   ├── IPublisher.md
│   │   └── MqttPublisher.md
│   └── gnss_simulator/
│       └── GnssSimulator.md
├── shared/
│   └── CMakeTips.md
└── template.md  ← Reusable format for all explainers
```
